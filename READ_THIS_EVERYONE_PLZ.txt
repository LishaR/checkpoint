Hi, this is Evan.  I finished some stuff.  

Things that need to be done soon:

Making lava actually kill the player
Ability to pick up and throw checkpoint
Detect when the player is landed (either though collisions or raycasting or something)
   so that you can't jump in mid-air
Graphics, sound effects, and music
Actually assign graphics to box2d objects based on their object type so that our final
   game isn't just a bunch of rectangles.
